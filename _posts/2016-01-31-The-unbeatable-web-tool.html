    <h1>The <span>unbeatable</span> web tool</h1>
    <article>
      <p>I am a self taught front-end developer. I've always been looking for the right tutorials online, reading books and searching online to improve my skills. It was probably 2 years ago (2014) when I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners">this little gem</a>.<p>

      <h1>Good things come in <span style="text-decoration: line-through; broder-bottom: 0!important;">threes</span> twos...</h1><p>What quickly attracted me to the Dev Tips channel was how consistant the uploads were, witout fail I would have at least 1 video a week not to mention the catching up I had to do. I started to comment on the videos saying thanks and sometimes asking questions if I was unsure of something. To my surprise I would get a response back every single time, this made it feel like a community and it was/is a great platform for me to learn.</p>

      <p>After a year of watching, practicing and learning I managed to secure a job as a brand stylist. There is no doubt in my mind that if I didn't stumble across that video of what I then called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnWIperMy08&feature=youtu.be">weirdly friendly guy in a hotel room</a>, I wouldn't have this job. The job was a huge personal achievement for me and I wanted to repay Travis so I became a Patreon</p>

      <p>Patreon is a platrom that puts people like me in a position to support people like Travis. Since getting my first pay cheque I have donated a small piece of it to Travis to show my appreciation, after all it's the cheapest for of education you'll find. Patreon's get special perks. One of those perks is a community chat with all the other Patreon's including Travis. It is simply the best tool I have. I can access the chat everywhere, it is filled with some of the most talented people and everyone is super friendly. I speak with the community every single day and never have I had an unanswered question</p>

      <p>The website on which you're reading this was built with the help of the communty. It's really such an invaluable tool and I would encourage anyone that has a couple of dollars to spare to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/DevTips">sign up</a> and get involved in something so great. If you don't have the funds to spare, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ">Dev Tips Youtube channel</a> for free content every week!</p>

        <p>I am a self taught front-end developer. I've always been looking for the right tutorials online, reading books and searching online to improve my skills. It was probably 2 years ago (2014) when I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners">this little gem</a> (Dev Tips).<p>

        <p>What quickly attracted me to the channel was how consistant the uploads were, witout fail I would have at least 1 video a week not to mention the catching up I had to do. I started to comment on the videos saying thanks and sometimes asking question if on was unsure of something. To my surprise I got a response back every single time, this made it feel like a community and it was/is a great platform for me to learn.</p>

        <p>After a year of watching, commenting and learning I managed to secure a job as a brand stylist. There is no doubt in my mind that if I didn't stumble across that video of what I then called the weirdly friendly guy in a hotel room, I would have this job. The job was a huge personal achievement for me and I wanted to repay Travis... but wasn't sure how...</p>

        <p>Travis would plug his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/DevTips?ty=c">Patreon channel</a> so I decided to check it out. Patreon is a platform for users to donate a sum of their choosing per video or per month. Exactly what wanted. With my first pay cheque I signed up to Patreon and to this day I happily donate a small sum to Travis.</p>

        <h2>The <span>best</span> was yet to come...</h2><p>I didn't realise that the Patreons got some great perks! One of them has improved my development skills tenfold. That perk is the Dev Tips community chat room, It's got over 100 members, some of which are the best developers and designers i've ever worked with. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. I've never had an unanswered question and have made some great friends.</p>

        <p>I really cannot explain how helpful this chat is, how much I have learned from it and how much I continue to learn from it.</p>

        <p>If you want to improve your design or development skills I cannot reccomend becoming a Patreon enough. If you need to consider it, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners">Dev Tips youtube channel</a>, it will not diappoint.</p>

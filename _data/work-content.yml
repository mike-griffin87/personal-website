  content: Amorae Bridal is an award winning bridal shop located in Essex, United Kingdom. Amorae wanted me to design and build their website from the ground up. Their key requirements included a mobile friendly site, a platform to involve with their brides and an engaging user experience.  I achieved this with a full screen background image on every page with a rotation of images on the home page. These images were supplied by their brides which helped create a continued communication with their clients. To make the user experience more engaging I used CSS3 and jQuery animations to create subtle interactive animations.

  content: I designed a business brochure for the town of Ongar and this is the branding to go with it. They requested something that was "uncluttered, trendy and easily recognisable". I achieved this by using the notable map location pin icon and a muted red colour to make it pop. To remove the main emphasis from the map pin I spit it with the text for the business directory.

  content: I designed the Ongar Christmas lights programme in 2012. This was a 6 page fold out brochure which included children’s games, jokes and a full year planner on the reverse. The theme was 1000 Santa’s and the cover had hundreds of little Santa clause. The 2012 Christmas lights brochure was received extremely well and I was re-commissioned to design their business directory.

They offer exam correction along with 1 to 1 Skype sessions and wanted their customers to be able to book these sessions online to reduce the amount of admin hours they previously spent phoning customers to confirm bookings. I build the site using Wordpress, Woo-commerce Bookly and Stripe to meet the clients requirements.

  content: This was a concept design for weight watchers. The idea behind it was to point out the struggle of dieting, how difficult it can be for people but no matter how dark it can get the grass is always greener. This was a fun personal project between client work and I learn a few things from the entire process.

I built them a one page Wordpress site to accommodate their needs and added the main navigation to give the impression of a larger site.
